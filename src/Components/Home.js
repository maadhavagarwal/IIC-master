          The *Institution’s Innovation Council (IIC), established by the **All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)* and the *Ministry of Education's Innovation Cell (MIC)*, aims to foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in higher education institutions (HEIs). It encourages students and faculty to engage in innovative thinking, problem-solving, and research activities. By establishing IICs in institutions, the goal is to create a dynamic and vibrant local ecosystem where innovation can flourish.

Through the IIC framework, institutions are guided in organizing regular workshops, hackathons, and innovation-based competitions that challenge students to address real-world problems. These activities help students gain practical experience and develop entrepreneurial mindsets, preparing them to contribute meaningfully to India's growing innovation landscape. Faculty members are also encouraged to mentor and collaborate with students, ensuring a supportive environment for innovation.

In addition, IICs serve as a bridge between academia, industry, and government. They facilitate knowledge exchange, provide incubation support, and create opportunities for startups to grow and scale. By encouraging collaboration and the development of novel solutions, IICs aim to produce future-ready graduates who can contribute to India's socio-economic development through innovation and entrepreneurship.
